# MCServer

Plugin for my Minecraft Server, I plan to use it for Testing plugins and host servers to play shit for me and my friends

The plugin(s) currently do:

- Lobby listeners (eg hunger, damage, block break/place)
- create subservers via pterodactyl
- manage subservers via pterodactyl (get status, stop,start,restart, run command, delete server, change name, specs, is
  private, invited players)
- join servers via navigator and velocity
- support for BUtils by [Banko](https://www.twitch.tv/derbanko) (automatically add license when installed on subserver)
- probably some more things I forgot (probably make a good README later)
