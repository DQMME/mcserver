# MCServer
Plugin for my Minecraft Server, I plan to use it for Testing plugins and host servers to play shit for me and my friends
The plugin currently does:
- Lobby listeners (eg hunger, damage, block break/place)
- create subservers via pterodactyl
- manage subservers via pterodactyl
- join servers via naviagtor and velocity (integrating velocity in next update)
